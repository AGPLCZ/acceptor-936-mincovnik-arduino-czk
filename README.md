### Key expansion from a password

Remembering 49-position random permutation that includes weird characters is
not very handy. You can instead derive the keys from an arbitrary string of
sufficient length.

"Sufficient" means "provides enough entropy". Full keys store around 208 bits
of entropy. To reach that, your password should have:

- at least around 61 decimal digits if made only from random decimal digits
- at least around 44 letters if made only from completely random letters
- at least around 40 alphanumeric characters if made randomly only from them
